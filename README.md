# Rendering Natural Camera Bokeh Effect with Deep Learning

## Abstract

Bokeh is an important artistic effect used to highlight the
main object of interest on the photo by blurring all out-of-
focus areas. While DSLR and system camera lenses can
render this effect naturally, mobile cameras are unable to
produce shallow depth-of-field photos due to a very small
aperture diameter of their optics. Unlike the current solu-
tions simulating bokeh by applying Gaussian blur to image
background, in this implementation of the paper conceptualised by the Andrey Ignatov and team at ETH Zurich Vision Lab, we try to learn a realistic
shallow focus technique directly from the photos produced
by DSLR cameras.
